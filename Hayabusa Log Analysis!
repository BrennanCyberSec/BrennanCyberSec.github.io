# HAYABUSA LOG ANALYSIS!

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to use Hayabusa to analyze Sysmon logs and detect suspicious activity related to process creation, network connections, and authentication events.

### Skills Learned

- Performed Windows event log triage using Sysmon and Security logs to identify suspicious process execution, network activity, and authentication behavior.
- Tracked how programs start, what they connect to on the network, and which users were logged in at the time.
- Connected events together over time to understand what happened first, what followed, and why it matters.
- Got comfortable separating normal system or admin activity from things that deserve closer attention.
- Documented results the way a junior analyst would for handoff or review by a team.

### Tools Used

- Hayabusa
- Sysmon
- Windows Event Logs
- Ubuntu 
- CSV and JSONL analysis workflows
