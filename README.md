🛡️ Brennan Vigna — Cybersecurity | Blue Team | SOC Analyst
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio and homelab documentation.
Here you’ll find me doing mostly Blue Team hands-on labs and writeups focused on SOC/Blue Team fundamentals: Active Directory, pfSense, Splunk, PCAP analysis, Linux hardening, and automation.
My goal is to show not only what I did, but how I think when completing tasks and why I did a specific action. 

To show what I actually did, I will have documentation, screenshots, critical thinking thought bubbles, and the satisfaction of learning new things along the way! Also, just a quick shoutout for all of the free learning material and teachers in this space. You all are truly appreciated in this journey and I will always be grateful for the accessible information to help me learn!
