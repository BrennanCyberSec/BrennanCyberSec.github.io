üõ°Ô∏è Brennan Vigna ‚Äî Cybersecurity | Blue Team | SOC Analyst | Detection Engineer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio and homelab documentation.
Here you‚Äôll find hands-on Blue Team and SOC-focused projects that demonstrate threat detection, log analysis, and incident response across both endpoint and network environments.
My goal is to show not only what I did, but how I think ‚Äî through detailed documentation, screenshots, detection logic, and lessons learned.
