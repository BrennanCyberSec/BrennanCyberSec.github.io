# About Me

Welcome! I'm Brennan, a cybersecurity student focused on purple team / SOC work. This site is where I document my labs, detection practice, and homelab projects as I build real security skills.

## What I'm building
- A home lab for security monitoring and incident response practice
- Repeatable lab writeups (tools, commands, screenshots, results)
- A portfolio that shows how I think

## What I'm learning right now
- Log analysis (Sysmon / Windows Event Logs)
- Detection engineering basics (Sigma rules, triage workflow)
- Linux + Bash + Python for security automation
- SIEM fundamentals (Splunk / Elastic-style workflows)
