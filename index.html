                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a cybersecurity student at Walsh College pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology with a focus on cybersecurity, set to graduate in June 2026. Currently working as an IT Support Analyst at Sehi Computer Products, where I investigate security alerts, analyze phishing attempts, and support system hardening efforts.</p>
                
                <p>This portfolio documents my journey in cybersecurity through hands-on lab exercises, security research, and practical skill development. My focus is on blue team operations, detection engineering, and building the technical expertise needed for SOC analyst and security operations roles.</p>
