# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Lab

This site documents my journey building a purple teaming architecture inspired by Kali Purple, called 'SOC in a box'. Plus labs for monioring, threat hunting, and vulnerability management.

## Tools Used
Some tools I will be using are Arkime and Malcolm for packet capture, Elastic Security for our SIEM, TheHive for doing carrying out incident response, and Suricata and Zeek for intrusion detection.

## What you'll find here

- Setup guides (Kali Purple, logging, SIEM basics)
- Tool notes and quick references
